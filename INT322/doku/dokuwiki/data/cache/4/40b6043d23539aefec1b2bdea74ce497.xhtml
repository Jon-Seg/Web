Most likely it&#039;s one of the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Plugin can&#039;t write to the media directory…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The program ran out of usable memory (RAM)…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You ran out of usable disk space…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You&#039;re experiencing an actual hardware failure (for instance, disk failure.)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other possibilities exist– execution time constraints, non-standard tar, gzip, bzip2, or something else completely different, but these aren&#039;t really as likely to occur.

<p>
Your best course of action is to check each item above, resolve it, and try again.

<p>
Don&#039;t forget to check your disk and RAM quotas for your host if you have them, and look for possible problems in your file system (very large files, for instance.)
